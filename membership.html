						<h2>Becoming a Member</h2>			
					</div>
					<p class="midnotice" style="float: right">Thank you for your interest in joining us. Please read this page thoroughly and speak with one of our officers before beginning the application process.</p>
					<h3>Know the Law</h3>
					<p>IATSE #320 will not allow an employer to falsely claim you as an independent contractor (something our competition does). What does that mean? When working for IATSE you are hired as an employee: unemployment insurance is paid on your behalf by the employer, and you have taxes taken out. (No more 1099's.) If you are not aware of the law make yourself aware. It is illegal for your employer to call you an independent contractor (<a href="http://www.lawskills.com/code/ga/48/7/127/">GA Code 48-7-127</a>).</p>
					<h3>Who Can Join?</h3>
					<p>We invite anyone working within our craft and interested in becoming a professional Union Stagehand to apply for membership. We are an equal opportunity organization. Members wishing to better their skills are given the opportunity through training programs. Timeliness and cleanliness are requirements of our members before we begin a work call. Solidarity and safety are our primary goals. Our members have earned the pride of their Local through hard work, professional attitudes, active interests in bettering their craft, commitment to their Brothers and Sisters, and reliability in the face of frequently demanding and challenging job conditions (also known as a "Big Show").</p>
					<h3>How Can You Join?</h3>
					<p>Membership to Local 320 is accomplished by submission of an IATSE Application for Membership accompanied by a <span style="color: red;">nonrefundable</span> $100 Application Fee. Application does not guarantee acceptance. Note that an applicant must be in good standing with the International to become a member of Local 320. (This means that if you have previously been a member of 320 or any other IATSE local, you must not owe any back debts.) Please contact one of our officers for an application. Once your application is submitted and approved by the General Office of the International, your application is subject to a vote by the body of the Local.<p>
					<p>Upon acceptance into Local 320, a $200 Initiation Fee is due within the first quarter of your membership, as well as payment for your first two quarters of dues. Quarterly dues are thereafter the Member's responsibility to pay to remain in good standing.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>2020 Dues - $65 per quarter ($260 yearly)</li>
						<li>2021 Dues - $67 per quarter ($268 yearly)</li>
						<!--<span class="footnote"> subject to change</span>-->
					</ul>
					<p>Dues may be paid via <a href="dues.html" class="noprint">this website</a><span class="printonly">our website at iatse320.org</span>, mailed to our <a href="contact.html">Mailing Address</a>, or presented to one of our Officers. Your dues pay the per capita of membership in IATSE, Local 320, the AFL-CIO, and the Savannah Central Labor Council.</p>
					<h3>Benefits of Joining</h3>
					<p>There are several benefits to becoming a member of our organization. We are tradesmen that take pride in our craft. Our members are close friends, more than that we are brothers and sisters, united in a similar cause, to promote trade unionism in the live entertainment industry. We have a great time when we get together for work or social events. Of course, our common interest is to provide work for our brothers and sisters. In addition to Community, we offer: 
					<ul>
						<li>Fair wages and decent working conditions. Overtime pay after 8 hours in a day and/or 40 hours per week. Compensation for missed meals, shortened turnarounds, etc.</li>
						<li>Safer working conditions. State and Federal safety laws enforced at all times. Workers comp protection on all our job sites (something not all our competition carries). Your health and well-being on the job are our priorities.</li>
						<li>Retirement savings plan. When working under our agreements, you will receive employer-paid contributions to the IATSE National Benefits Funds Annuity Plan, at a rate currently 7% above gross earnings.</li>
						<li>Health and Welfare benefits. When working under our agreements, you will receive employer paid contribution to the <a href="https://www.iatsenbf.org/">IATSE National Benefits Fund</a> Health and Welfare (H&amp;W) program. In this program, each referral has their own account that can be used for reimbursing out-of-pocket medical costs and obtaining insurance when eligible.</li>
						<li>Procedures for grievances. A Job Steward, Business Agent and legal counsel are available to respond to serious problems in the workplace.</li>
						<li>Discounts for services. Through the <a href="http://www.unionplus.org">Union Plus</a> program, members can receive discounts for a variety of goods and service, from car rental to health care. <a href="http://www.unionplus.org">Find out more about Union Plus by clicking here</a>.
